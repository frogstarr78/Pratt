ANNOUNCE: Tile Widget Set, version 0.8.2.

~ What is it?

The Tile widget set is an experimental reimplementation
of some of the standard Tk widgets.  The main features are:

    + Native look and feel under Windows (XP, NT, and 2K)
    + Nearly-native look and feel under Mac OSX
    + "Revitalized" look and feel under X11
    + Appearance controlled by a theme engine, providing
      greater flexibility for custom widgets
    + New widgets, including notebook, progressbar, combobox,
      separator, and sizegrip.

The Tile widget set has been integrated into Tk 8.5.0.
The tile extension works with Tk 8.4.5 and up.

~ What's New in 0.8.2

A number of minor incompatibilities were introduced when
tile was integrated into the core.  Tile 0.8.2 is a transitional
release, intended to be backward-compatible with Tile 0.7.8 and
forward-compatible with Tk 8.5.   See "Incompatible changes", below.

~ New features

    + New ttk::notebook 'hide' command

    + Many improvements to the ttk::combobox widget.  The combobox
      almost works properly on OSX now.

    + ttk::treeview widget column resize behavior has been much improved.
      Horizontal scrolling works now.

    + ttk::treeview widget: -displaycolumns {} now means "no columns" instead
      of "all columns".  Use -displaycolumns #all for "all columns".
      -displaycolumns #all is the default; code that didn't use
      -displaycolumns is unaffected.

    + ttk::panedwindow widget: Better support for saving and restoring
      pane configurations.

~ Incompatible changes

    + All routines in the tile::* namespace are no longer supported.

    + [style] command has been renamed to [ttk::style].

    + ttk::paned widget has been renamed to ttk::panedwindow.

    + ttk::dialog widget lives in its own package now; use
      [package require ttk::dialog] to access it.

    + [style default] 0.6 compatibility method is gone.
      If you haven't changed this to [style configure] already,
      you should do so when you're rewriting everything to use
      [ttk::style].

    + image element factory now takes an imageSpec argument instead
      of a separate image name and -map option.  For example:

      	style element create foo image $base -map {disabled $grayed}

      should be changed to:

      	ttk::style element create foo image [list $base  disabled $grayed]

~ On version numbers

To help distinguish formal releases from CVS snapshots,
the subminor version number will be incremented immediately before
and immediately after making a release.  Thus odd-numbered subminor
versions indicate a CVS snapshot, and even-numbered ones indicate
a known release.
